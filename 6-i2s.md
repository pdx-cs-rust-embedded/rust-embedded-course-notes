## I2C

* "Inter-Integrated Circuit" (had to look that up).

* Yet another serial protocol, of possibly a million serial
  protcols.
  
* Base rate is 100Kb/sec, but modern stuff can go faster.

* I2C is a "bus": multiple devices can be connected to it
  and communicate pairwise (usually).
  
* Asymmetric: "controller" and "target" speak two sides of
  protocol.
  
  (Formerly "master" and "slave", but that terminology is
  slowly being erased.)
  
## I2C For Software Folks

* This is not entirely a byte-oriented protocol: bit-strings
  of any length can be sent.
  
  For example, bus addresses (an identifier for a chip)
  can be either 7-bit or 10-bit.
  
* A given device has "registers": just subaddresses denoting
  specific bytes of data.

* The controller drives all transactions:

  * To read a register, the controller writes the target
    device address and register address(es) to the bus. The
    target responds by placing the register data on the bus.

    Note that the bus is owned by the pair during the
    transaction: no other controller or host is allowed to
    do business.

  * To write a register, the controller writes the target
    device address, register address(es) and data value(s)
    to the bus.
    
* There's a complicated START/END NAK/ACK thing going on
  here. Rarely you have to understand it, which is horrible.
  
## I2C On The nRF

* A hardware unit called the TWIM (Three-Wire Interface
  Module) on the nRF knows how to read and write I2C.

* It performs DMA (Direct Memory Access), so once a
  transaction is started by your program you can go do other
  things while it is carried out.
  
* In practice, you usually want to block on transactions
  anyway. Also, since DMA, the bytes to be sent and received
  must live in RAM, not ROM (flash), which is a pain.
  
## The MB2 Accelerometer / Magnetometer / Thermometer

* LSM303AGR. Measures linear acceleration, works as a
  compass, works as a thermometer.
  
* Is an I2C device.

* The thermometer thing doesn't seem widely appreciatedâ€¦

* Let's look at the data sheet.

## The lsm303agr Crate

* Provides a high-level interface to this device through 
  the HAL.
  
* This is the way, when you have it.

* Let's look at thermometer code. That's way easier than
  starting with the complex
  devices. http://github.com/pdx-cs-rust-embedded/mb2-thermometer

* (Note that we also read the CPU thermometer here. That's
  relatively easy.)
  
## Without A Crate

* Sometimes you don't have a fancy Rust crate sitting around
  for your device. Then you have to do I2C (or whatever)
  yourself.
  
* Let's look at a raw I2C version of our thermometer code
  and talk about the challenges there.

# Care And Feeding Of Magic Hardware

* The MB2 is an embedded paradise. When this course is over,
  you'll be looking at:
  
  * Boards without much Rust support.
  * Crates that don't include the device features you need.
  * Non-ARM processors.

* Spend some time with this well-documented setup and
  support from us.
  
  * Read the source code for the underlying crates: they're
    full of great magic.
  
  * Read the docs for a device either on the nRF or
    elsewhere. Try to understand how you would talk to it
    if you didn't have pre-packaged software.
